//What is the principal amount? 1500
//What is the rate? 4.3
//What is the number of years? 6
//What is the number of times the interest is compounded per year? 4
//$1500 invested at 4.3% for 6 years compounded 4 times per year is $1938.84.
//The formula youâ€™ll use for this is A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t) where

//P is the principal amount.
//r is the annual rate of interest.
//t is the number of years the amount is invested.
//n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
//A is the amount at the end of the investment.
